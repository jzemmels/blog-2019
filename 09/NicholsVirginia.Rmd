**Write a blog post answering the following questions and detailing the progress: **

1. The `xml2` R package can be used to work with xml files. Write a function, `current_weather` that accepts a 4-letter airport code (KAMW in the URL here: https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KAMW.xml) and returns a data frame with the airport location (station ID, latitude, longitude), last update time, and current weather information (temperature, weather condition, wind speed and direction) at that airport. 

The `xml2` functions `read_xml`, `xml_children`, `xml_name`, and `xml_text` will be useful. Remember to handle errors and check inputs, and make sure to return a data frame with appropriate data types. 

```{r q1, warning=F, message=F}
library(xml2)
library(tidyverse)
library(assertthat)
library(stringr)


current_weather <- function(mycode){

  
  mycode <- "KAMW"
  assertthat::assert_that(stringr::str_length(mycode) == 4)
  assertthat::assert_that(is.character(mycode))
  
  # Proceeed....
  a <- xml2::read_xml(paste0("https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/", mycode, ".xml"))
chldrn <- xml_children(a)
cnms <- xml_name(chldrn)
ctxt <- xml_text(chldrn)

dat <- tibble(mynames = cnms,
           mytxt = ctxt) %>%
  filter(mynames %in% c("station_id", "latitude", "longitude", "observation_time",
                        "temperature_string", "weather", "wind_string")) %>%
  as.data.frame()

assertthat::assert_that(is.data.frame(dat))

return(dat)
}


current_weather("KAMW")

```


2. Which HTML tags did you investigate? Describe how to format at least 3 separate pieces of a document using HTML tags.

**Images**
They do not have a closing tag. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

<img src="img_dog.jpg" alt="Not a cat">

```

**Color**
I can set text color
```{r, eval = F}
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>

```
with the style attribute. 

**Style**
Here I learned about the style attribute in contexts outside of just color. 
```{r, eval = F}
<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>

```

3. Compile this Rmarkdown document to HTML, then open the HTML file in a web browser. Open the inspector console for your browser (Ctrl-Shift-I in Chrome, Ctrl-Shift-C in Firefox) and look at the HTML code corresponding to various parts of the document. <br>
Answer the following questions:

    - What types of tags did you find? 

code, span, div...body, p, and html are things I recognize. 

    - How are code chunks formatted in HTML?

As pre class = 'r' tags?

    - What differences are there in the HTML markup for R code chunks and R output blocks?
    
I think it's just the class. class = 'r' indicates code, while....I don't know.     
    
4. In R, the `rvest` package, which is part of the tidyverse, makes it (relatively) easy to pull specific pieces from structured documents. The `html_nodes` function selects nodes using either xpath or css, and additional functions such as `html_attrs`, `html_text`, and `html_table` pull information out of the markup text.<br>
Choose a Wikipedia page that has at least one image to test the `rvest` package out

```{r}
library(rvest)
wpie <- xml2::read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie")

wpie_img <- wpie %>% 
  rvest::html_node("img")

```
I don't know what to do with the image now that I have it.
